## Usage

### CLI Mode

Control your lights with simple commands:

```bash
# Turn lights on/off
keylight on                    # Turn on all lights
keylight off                   # Turn off all lights

# Brightness control
keylight bright +              # Increase brightness by 5%
keylight bright -              # Decrease brightness by 5%
keylight bright =              # Equalize brightness across all lights
keylight bright 50             # Set brightness to 50%

# Temperature control
keylight temp +                # Increase temperature by 200K
keylight temp -                # Decrease temperature by 200K
keylight temp =                # Equalize temperature across all lights
keylight temp 4000             # Set temperature to 4000K

# Information

On first run, it will automatically discover Elgato Key Lights on your network.

- **Shortcuts**:
  - `a`: Select all lights
  - `1`/`2`: Select individual lights
  - `d`: Discover lights
  - `Enter`: Apply action
  - `q`: Quit

#### Features

- **Toggle**: Switch lights on/off
- **Turn Off/On**: Explicit power control
- **Brightness**: Adjust from 3% to 100% in 5% increments
- **Temperature**: Adjust from 2900K (warm) to 7000K (cool) in 200K steps

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `~/.config/keylight/config.json`:

```json
{
  "lights": {
    "Elgato Key Light 1": "192.168.1.100",
    "Elgato Key Light 2": "192.168.1.101"
  },
  "lastBrightness": 50,
  "lastTemperature": 4000
}
```

## Using with Loupedeck

For Loupedeck or other automation tools, use the `||` separator syntax:

```
/Users/javieralonso/elgato/keylight-go||1
/Users/javieralonso/elgato/keylight-go||on
/Users/javieralonso/elgato/keylight-go||bright +
```

### Troubleshooting Loupedeck

If commands fail in Loupedeck but work in Terminal:

1. **Use the logging wrapper** to debug:
   ```
   /Users/javieralonso/elgato/keylight-log.sh||1
   ```
   Check `/tmp/keylight-debug.log` for errors

2. **Grant network permissions** - On first run from Loupedeck, macOS may prompt for network access. Click "Allow"

3. **Check Firewall settings** - Go to System Settings > Network > Firewall and ensure the app has network access

4. **Retry logic** - The app automatically retries failed connections up to 3 times, which handles most transient network issues
